This zip file contains two separate files of data associated with approved FCC Forms 471 filed for 
Funding Year 2010 (July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011). Also included in this package are two DDL

OPENDATA_FY2010
===============

This file contains data associated with all Funding Year 2010 FCC Forms 471 that were received 
during the application filing window, and that have received a Funding Commitment Decision 
Letter (FCDL) approving funding. These FCDLs provide a final funding decision for all funding 
requests included in the FCC Form 471 application. Applications that were started but never 
completed, or which were received after the FCC Form 471 application filing window closed, as 
well as applications that were either denied in full or cancelled, or those for which a final 
funding decision has not yet been made, are not included. 

This file contain data points include data from Blocks 1 and 5 of the FCC Form 471 as well as 
some additional data regarding the funding decision and some aggregate disbursement data. 

FY2010_COMMITTEDFRNS_BLOCK4_DATA
==================================

This second data file includes a list of all of the schools and libraries that are receiving service for 
each of the funding requests listed in the first data file. This file contains information about the 
school or library, as well as the information needed to calculate the E-rate discount for the 
entity, including the percentage of students who are eligible for the National School Lunch 
Program (NSLP).  The file contains the FCC Form 471, FRN and FCC Form 471 Item 22, which 
allows users to link the specific list of recipients of service to the individual funding request 
included in OPENDATA_FY2010. Some funding request may only provide service to a single 
entity, while others can include service to multiple entities. Therefore, the number of lines for a 
given funding request in this file will vary. Finally, note that when different organizations apply 
for services for the same entity, they may report different discount information.
